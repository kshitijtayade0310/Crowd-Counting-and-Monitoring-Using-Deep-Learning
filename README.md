# Crowd-Counting-and-Monitoring-Using-Deep-Learning
Designed and implemented a deep learning model to estimate
crowd density and monitor real-time crowd activity.
Utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process video
feeds and images for accurate crowd counting and density
estimation
Preprocessed data by curating diverse datasets with annotated
crowd images for model training and evaluation.
Achieved high accuracy and scalability by leveraging state-of-theart architectures such as MobileNet and VGG16 for lightweight
and efficient deployment.
Integrated the model with a real-time monitoring system, enabling
proactive crowd management and safety measures.
Demonstrated significant improvement in computational
efficiency compared to traditional image processing methods.
